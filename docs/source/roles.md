# Roles

A TRE conforming to the SATRE specification should provide a broadly similar experience for stakeholders operating in each of these defined roles.
There is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping between roles and people.
One person can have multiple roles.

## TRE users

The researchers working on projects that involve logging into a TRE to access data.

<!-- The document will explain that user experience of the platform and associated documentation should feel similar across TREs conforming to SATRE specification. -->

```{list-table}

  - Role description

```

(admin_roles)=

## TRE administration roles

The IT and related professionals who will be responsible for deploying and managing instances of a TRE conforming to the SATRE specification.
These roles cover managing TRE computing infrastructure, but also administering the TRE itself (_e.g._ managing users and projects).

<!-- The document will explain that SATRE conforming TREs should have documentation and infrastructure deployment code/apps that conform to software engineering best practices, which are also defined here, making them "simple" for an IT professional to follow; troubleshooting steps included. -->

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-tre-role-administrator

* - Role name
  - Role description
* - Output checker
  - Person or people responsible disclosure control via checking of project outputs destined for egress from the TRE.
```

## TRE developer roles

The software engineers responsible for developing and maintaining TRE software, including adding functionality, bug fixes and general maintenance.

<!-- The document will explain recommended practices suitable for developing a software of this complexity and reference learnings from existing TRE developers. -->

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-tre-role-developer

* - Role name
  - Role description
* -

```

## TRE governance roles

Roles that uphold the governance of TREs.
Such governance responsibilities typically involve establishing policies and procedures to ensure the responsible use of data, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of research participants, and promoting transparency and accountability in research activities.
Typical roles might include data custodians, ethicists, an independent board or a lay panel.
