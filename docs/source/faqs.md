(what_tre)=

## What is a TRE?

TRE stands for "Trusted Research Environment". The simplest definition tends to be *any* kind of computing environment set up for research with sensitive data that has built-in security controls and user access management features. The definition of TRE relevant to SATRE also encompasses the set of information governance and data management processes alongside the computing technology used to support research with sensitive data; the definition of sensitive data being broadly any data for which there may be considerations around disclosure control, for any reason.

We recognise that in the UK several other names such a "Secure Data Environment" or "Data Safe Haven" have been used in the literature on computing with sensitive data, and that these systems may go by other names elsewhere.

(why_satre)=

## Why do we need a Standard Architecture for TREs

(is_standard)=

## Is SATRE an ISO technical standard?

No. The SATRE specification aims to provide a helpful guide for TRE Operators, Developers and Builders. It can be used to inform the development process of new TREs, or to evaluate existing TREs and inform how they could be improved. Evaluating a TRE with the SATRE specification may help to identify which technical standards (e.g. ISO 27001) are already met and which (if any) are desirable to work towards meeting.

(is_everything)=

## Does SATRE provide everything I need to build a TRE?

No. The SATRE specification defines a set of stakeholder {ref}`roles <satre_roles>` and feature {ref}`capabilities <satre_pillars>` for TREs, which were decided according to these {ref}`architectural principles <satre_principles>`. It does not dictate which specific technologies could or should be used to build a TRE.

(how_build)=

## How do I build and run a SATRE compliant TRE?

We encourage TRE Operators and Builders to publicly evaluate their TREs against the SATRE specification; see {ref}`evaluation`. TRE Developers can use the specification and published TRE evaluations as a starting point. Some of evaluated TREs such as the Alan Turing Institute's "Data Safe Haven" and Dundee HIC's "TREEHOOSE" are deployed from open source infrastructure-as-code, and can be deployed by other institutions.

(support_federation)=

## Does SATRE describe approaches to TRE federation or interoperability of TREs?

No. However, it's intended that SATRE could form the foundation for future standards and guidance on federation, interoperability, and related work.

(how_developed)=

## How has the SATRE specification been developed and why?

See the information on the homepage of {ref}`these docs <satre_why>`.
