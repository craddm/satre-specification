* - Question
  - Answer
* - Is SATRE an ISO technical standard?
  - No. The SATRE specification aims to provide a helpful guide for TRE Operators, Developers and Builders. It can be used to evaluate existing TREs and inform how they could be improved, or inform the development process of new TREs.
* - Does SATRE provide everything I need to build a TRE?
  - No. The SATRE specification defines a set of stakeholder {ref}`roles <satre_roles>` and feature {ref}`capabilities <satre_pillars>` for TREs, which were decided according to these {ref}`architectural principles <satre_principles>`. It does not dictate which specific technologies could or should be used to build a TRE.
* - How do I build and run a SATRE compliant TRE?
  - We encourage TRE Operators and Builders to publicly evaluate their TREs against the SATRE specification, see {ref}`evaluation`. TRE Developers can use the specification and published TRE evaluations as a starting point. Some of evaluated TREs such as the Alan Turing Institute's "Data Safe Haven" and Dundee HIC's "TREEHOOSE" are deployed from open source infrastructure-as-code, and can be deployed by other institutions.
