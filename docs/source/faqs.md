* - Question
  - Answer
* - Is SATRE an ISO technical standard?
  - No. The SATRE specification aims to provide a helpful guide for TRE Operators, Developers and Builders. It can be used to evaluate existing TREs and inform how they could be improved, or inform the development process of new TREs.
* - Does SATRE provide everything I need to build a TRE?
  - No. The SATRE specification defines a set of stakeholder {ref}`roles <satre_roles>` and feature {ref}`capabilities <satre_pillars>` for TREs, which were decided according to these {ref}`architectural principles <satre_principles>`. It does not dictate or even suggest specific technologies that could or should be used to build a TRE.
