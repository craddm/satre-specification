* - Question
  - Answer
* - Is SATRE an ISO technical standard?
  - No. The SATRE specification aims to provide a helpful guide for TRE Operators, Developers and Builders. It can be used to inform the development process of new TREs, or to evaluate existing TREs and inform how they could be improved. Evaluating a TRE with the SATRE specification may help to identify which technical standards (e.g. ISO 27001) are already met and which (if any) are desirable to work towards meeting.
* - Does SATRE provide everything I need to build a TRE?
  - No. The SATRE specification defines a set of stakeholder {ref}`roles <satre_roles>` and feature {ref}`capabilities <satre_pillars>` for TREs, which were decided according to these {ref}`architectural principles <satre_principles>`. It does not dictate which specific technologies could or should be used to build a TRE.
* - How do I build and run a SATRE compliant TRE?
  - We encourage TRE Operators and Builders to publicly evaluate their TREs against the SATRE specification; see {ref}`evaluation`. TRE Developers can use the specification and published TRE evaluations as a starting point. Some of evaluated TREs such as the Alan Turing Institute's "Data Safe Haven" and Dundee HIC's "TREEHOOSE" are deployed from open source infrastructure-as-code, and can be deployed by other institutions.
* - How has the SATRE specification been developed and why?
  - See the information on the homepage of {ref}`these docs <satre_why>`.
* - Who has developed the SATRE specification?
  - Take a look at out {ref}`contributors` page.
