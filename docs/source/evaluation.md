# Evaluating TREs against SATRE

## How to score

You should score your TRE against each statement in the SATRE specification.
The scoring system is:

- 0: **Fail** (we do not do this)
- 1: **Needs improvement** (we do this but want to do better)
- 2: **Sufficient** (we do this and are currently happy with it)
