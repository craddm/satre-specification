# Evaluating TREs against SATRE

## How to score

You should score your TRE against each statement in the SATRE specification.
The scoring system is:

- **0 (Fail)**: we do not do this
- **1 (Needs improvement)**: we do this but want to do better
- **2 (Sufficient)**: we do this and are currently happy with it

## Examples

- Evaluation of {ref}`The Alan Turing Institute Data Safe Haven <evaluation_alan_turing_institute>`.
- Evaluation of {ref}`Dundee/HIC TREEHOOSE <evaluation_dundee_hic>`.
