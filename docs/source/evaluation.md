# Evaluating TREs against SATRE

## How to score

You should score your TRE against each statement in the SATRE specification.
The scoring system is:

- **0 (Fail)**: we do not do this
- **1 (Needs improvement)**: we do this but want to do better
- **2 (Sufficient)**: we do this and are currently happy with it

## Examples

### Turing Data Safe Haven

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-turing-dsh-ig

* -
  - Score
  - Response
* - 1.1.1.
  - 1
  - - We rely on the Turing legal and data protection teams to inform us of necessary legal requirements.
    - The Turing DSH is self-assessed against the NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit.
    - The Turing has a centralised ethics approval procedure which all projects are required to follow.
    - Project specific requirements are discussed with data providers before start of each project.
    ##### Potential Improvements
    - We could be more proactive about trying to stay up-to-date with changes to requirements.
    - For instance, we could hold an annual review with the Turing Legal and Data Protection teams to ensure all current requirements are still met by the TRE organisation.
* - 1.1.2.
  - 1
  - - We have documented our institutional risk appetite and understand what kinds of work we are prepared to support.
    - All projects handled in the Turing Data Safe Haven have gone through our institutional Data Protection Assessment Process and Ethics Approval Process.
    - All projects are tracked through a ticketing system with relevant documents and agreements stored on Sharepoint.
    ##### Potential Improvements
    - We would like to improve our document handling workflow.
    - This could be through the development of an Information Governance App through which all projects can be managed directly by approved users
* - 1.1.3.
  - 1
  - - The Turing has institute-wide Legal and Data Protection Teams who ensure that projects meet our institutional requirements.
    - Our sysadmin team is currently appropriately sized for the number of projects we are handling.
    - The Legal and data protection teams do not have staff dedicated to our TRE.
    ##### Potential Improvements
    - Our TRE organisation does not control staff numbers in the legal and data protection teams.
    - Assigned staffing to the DSH would create streamline resource provision for our TRE organisation.
