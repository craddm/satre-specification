# Evaluating TREs against SATRE

## How to score

You should score your TRE against each statement in the SATRE specification.
The scoring system is:

- 0: **Not met** Does not meet requirements
- 1: **Sufficient** Requirements met but substantial scope for improvement
- 2: **Satisfied** Requirements met and limited scope for improvement 

0 means you have failed to meet the requirement. 
A score of 1 or above means you have met the requirement.
Although both 1 and 2 indicate a TRE meets the requirement, the distinction lies in the quality of the components which address the requirement.
