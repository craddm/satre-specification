# Evaluating TREs against SATRE

Use this guide to evaluate your organisation's TRE provision against the SATRE specification.
Below you can find both the method for evaluation, and example evaluations for your reference from the Alan Turing Institute and the Health Informatics Centre.

## Method

You should score your TRE against each statement in the SATRE specification.
The scoring system is:

- 0: **Not met** Does not meet requirements
- 1: **Sufficient** Requirements met but substantial scope for improvement
- 2: **Satisfied** Requirements met and limited scope for improvement

0 means you have failed to meet the requirement.
A score of 1 or above means you have met the requirement.
Although both 1 and 2 indicate a TRE meets the requirement, the distinction lies in the quality of the components which address the requirement.

The simplest form of evaluation is to simply give your TRE scores for each statement.
We recommend a more detailed evaluation, which includes a score, supporting text and, where applicable, explicit areas of potential improvement.

In the examples we go into detail with our supporting text.
We hope you find this useful as a reference point when evaluating your TRE.

## Meeting the specification

To meet the specification, your TRE should score at least 1 on every mandatory statement.
