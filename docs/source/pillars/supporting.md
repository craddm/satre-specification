# Supporting Capabilities

## Public Involvement and Engagement

_How a TRE organisation involves the public in its processes and work._

<!--
Rationale:

- PIE work is important to building and maintaining trust.
- Use of public data is sometimes critical to research, for example health research.
- The public can benefit from sharing their data, to trustworthy and safe research projects, for example in the development of better health treatments or social policies.
- Meeting other parts of this specification helps ensure that data is secure and that data processing is legal, appropriate and ethical.
- Optional as there are cases (for example research with purely non-personal, commercial data) where involving the public is less important and may even be undesirable.
- We particularly encourage meeting this capability for work involving personal data belonging to the public such as health or administrative data.
