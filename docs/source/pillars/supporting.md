## Public Involvement and Engagement

_How the TRE organisation involves the public in its processes and work in order to maintain trust in its operations._

<!--
Rationale:

- PIE work is important to building and maintaining trust.
- Use of public data is sometimes critical to research, for example health research.
- The public can benefit from sharing their data, to trustworthy and safe research projects, for example in the development of better health treatments or social policies.
- Meeting other parts of this specification helps ensure that data is secure and that data processing is legal, appropriate and ethical.
- Optional as there are cases (for example research with purely non-personal, commercial data) where involving the public is less important and may even be undesirable.
- We particularly encourage meeting this capability for work involving personal data belonging to the public such as health or administrative data.
-->

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab-supporting-pie
* - Statement
  - Guidance
  - Importance
* - You publicly share the details of any projects which use the TRE.
  - This may be via the TRE website or annual reports.
  - Optional
* - You include members of the public in your approvals process.
  - This may be carried out via a separate public panel or by including members of the public on an approvals panel.
  - Optional
* - All public engagement activities are representative and inclusive.
  - Any public engagement activity carried out by TREs should make sure they are involving a representative sample where possible and that activities are accessible and open.
    This could include following guidelines such as [PEDRI](https://www.pedri.org.uk/).
  - Optional
```


## Legal services

_The ability of the TRE organisation to access suitable and timely legal advice._

<!-- Specific requirements? _e.g._ Article 32 of the GDPR requires organisations to regularly test and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures employed to protect personal data, and penetration testing is an effective way of assessing your technical defences. -->
